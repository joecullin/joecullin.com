# joecullin.com

Code for the www.joecullin.com site.

## Overview

Once in a while I wipe the slate clean and do something totally different.

Sometimes I prioritize ease of maintenance. Other times I do weird things just to learn new tech.

## Current iteration

Currently this is a fairly boring site with just a few static html files.

Some of the site content in a different repo: https://github.com/joecullin/joecullin-content/ . After almost 15 years I got tired of keeping up with WordPress updates, and I thought it would be interesting (and easier) to try exporting it to static html.

## Past highlights:

`d8f148d7276656baeb4d91158fa2dd44a713131d` - iteration of the site that used:
- Docker with Apache for local dev using PHP.
- Custom gulp plugin to create static HTML files from the PHP.
- Deploy to staging & prod with gulp.
