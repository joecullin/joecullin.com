          <h1>My R&eacute;sum&eacute;</h1>

          <p>
            Current status: happy where I am, and open to interesting new opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've had roles ranging from senior developer to director of a large multi-office set of teams. Recruiters tend to assume I'm interested in a manager/director track. I wouldn't rule that out if it's a perfect fit, but&mdash;
          </p> 

          <p> 
My sweet spot is a developer/leader mix:
<ul>
  <li>I love hands-on work, quickly acquiring deep knowledge of code & systems & data.</li>
  <li>I love helping to solve organizational & people challenges.</li>
  <li>I'm a huge fan of continuous improvement, for myself, my team, and the systems we use.</li>
  <li>I love helping other developers find and fix bugs.</li>
  <li>I'm pragmatic and focused on business/customer needs.</li>
  <li>I have a long record of meeting tough goals while still delivering maintainable software.</li>
  <li>I always support good leaders and work well with them.</li>
  <li>I don't shy away from taking on leadership tasks when needed, regardless of my position/title.</li>
</ul>
