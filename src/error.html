      Oh no! Looks like we had an error.<br/>
      Try the <a href="/">homepage</a>.

      I finally ditched my 14-year-old wordpress install. I moved some of the content to static files, but there's some older, sillier stuff that I'm not sure I'll bother preserving. <br/>
      In the meantime, the "newer" part of my site (everything without "/site" in the url) is still working. That's been a static site for a few years now. <br/>
      Feel free to reach out to me (joe@joecullin.com) if there's something missing and you want me to fix it.
